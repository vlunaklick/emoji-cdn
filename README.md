# Emoji Catcher & Picker

In this project, I have re-implemented a CDN for emojis originally created by Ben Borgers using JavaScript and Node.js. The CDN is powered by Express and 'express-expenditious', which allows for efficient delivery of emoji files. In addition, I have developed an emoji picker feature that allows users to easily search and select from a variety of different emoji styles. This emoji picker demonstrates the functionality of the CDN API and provides a user-friendly interface for selecting and inserting emojis into text.
