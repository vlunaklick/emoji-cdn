# Emoji Catcher

Emoji Catcher is a CDN service built with Node.js and Express that enables users to get PNG images of emojis through their URL. Inspired by Ben Borgers' version, this project allows users to choose from different emoji styles, such as Apple or Google, through a simple "?style=" query. To provide a smooth and uninterrupted experience for the user, the express-expenditious library was implemented to optimize loading speed through caching the emoji images.
